Two Python scripts that deal with substitution ciphers.

subcipher.py: 
This is a Python script that can both encrypt and decrypt substitution ciphers using a given key.
The user is first asked to input a key in the form of every letter of the alphabet, used once.
Then the user is asked whether or not they want to encrypt or decrypt.
Then they are prompted to enter their message that will be encrypted or decrypted depending on what they choose.

cipherintercept.py
This Python script uses frequency analysis on an inputted text to find the most accurate decryption. However, this is not perfect.
The user can also swap letters until they choose to be finished, to perfect the decryption of the message. Two text files are needed to run this.
One for the input text and the other for a list of letter frequencies.
